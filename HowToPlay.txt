*WORK IN PROGRESS*
I'm currently deploying this game in the cloud. That'll make it so it's MUCH easier to play. 

* * * 
You'll need to have docker installed to play the game.

MAC OS Link: https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac/

LINUX Link: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

After installing docker, navigate to the run.sh (linux) or run_on_mac.sh (mac). 
Copy the contents of the .sh file. 
Now type these quick commands into your terminal!

cd Desktop
nano play_time.sh (you can call it anything you'd like, but keep the .sh at the end!)
paste the contents of the run/run_on_mac.sh into the new file you made. 
Hit ctrl x
Hit y
Hit enter 
Type: chmod +x play_time.sh (or whatever you called it)
Now simply type ./play_time.sh (or whatever you called it)
Wait for the download to finish (it may take a while on mac)
Now enjoy! 

Note: If you already have java installed on your machine, it may be easier to just clone the repo and run the game. Again, I'm still working on a way to make this game easier to play.
